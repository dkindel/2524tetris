To install tkinter (required for running this application), run "sudo apt-get install python-tk".  Run the Application by running "./Controller.py" in the directory containing 'Controller.py', 'Matrix.py', and 'Shape.py'.  If the Application fails to run, in 'Controller.py', replace "from Tkinter import *" with "from tkinter import *" in line 7 (notice the capitilization on Tkinter).  The change is due to changes from python 2 to python 3.
