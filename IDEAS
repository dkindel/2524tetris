game: A simple Tetris game that will record high scores in a certain data format, as well as some statistics for lifetime games. However, users should not be able to easily edit the file to try to cheat on high scores or stats. The data should be in an encrypted form and should have some checking bits or algorithm to prevent user from hacking the data format. Namely, if the checking bits don't match with the data, the file will be considered corrupted and will not be parsed.
