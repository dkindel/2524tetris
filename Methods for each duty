Required Methods

I suggest using tkinter instead of curses.  This is the standard python GUI toolkit.
This makes handling events and drawing the board itself much easier and looking better.

Matrix (15x10 2D array)
  - get matrix
  - update matrix with current piece
  - initialize matrix function
  - subtract row function
  - test valid move from current shape

Event Handlers
  - Look for key press events.
    - left or right, move left or right.
    - key press to rotate
    - another key press to immediately drop the piece (not necessary but would be nice)
    - timer event to lower the piece by 1 row - call run in main
    - decide if end game
    

Current Shape - must have shape, rotation, and board location data)
  - get shape type (Z, S, L, I, O, J, T)
  - set shape type
  - get rotation (possible rotations for each piece. (Either 1, 2, or 4))
  - set rotation
  - Rotate piece (takes param counter clockwise or clockwise...possibly as boolean?)
    - may need to know the center of a piece to rotate around.  
  - Move piece (left or right)
    - update the matrix, then call the redraw board method
  - To test if a valid move, we can move, test if valid, and the unmake if required
  
GUI
  - redraw board 
    - get new matrix
    - get current piece
  
Overall
  - Initialize
    - board (matrix)
    - current falling piece
    - score
  - Run method that repeats at a specified time
    - calls method to update the boolean matrix with a new matrix and new current shape position
  - get random next shape
  - increment score
  - handle game ending
